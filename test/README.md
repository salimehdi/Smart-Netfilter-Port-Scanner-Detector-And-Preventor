Simple Python Port Scanner (test.py)OverviewThis is a basic Python script designed to perform a TCP port scan against a target IP address. Its primary purpose is to serve as a testing tool for the Smart Netfilter Port Scanner Detector kernel module. By simulating a port scan, it allows you to verify that the kernel module is working correctly by detecting the scan and blocking the source IP.How It WorksThe script operates using the following logic:It iterates through a predefined range of TCP ports (8000 to 8020 by default).For each port, it creates a new TCP socket.It uses the non-blocking socket.connect_ex() method to attempt a connection. This method returns 0 if the port is open and an error code otherwise.A short timeout (1 second) is set on the socket to prevent the script from hanging on unresponsive ports.A small delay (0.1 seconds) is added between each connection attempt to control the scan speed.The status of each port ("Open" or "Closed") is printed to the console.RequirementsPython 3The socket and time libraries are part of the standard Python library, so no external packages are needed.ConfigurationBefore running the script, you must edit the target variable to match the IP address of the machine you want to scan (the machine running the kernel module).Open test.py and modify this line:# !!! IMPORTANT: Change this to your target machine's IP address !!!
target = "192.168.1.9"
UsageOnce you have configured the target IP address, you can run the script from your terminal from a machine other than your target.python3 test.py
Expected OutcomeWhen you run this script against a machine with the Smart Netfilter Port Scanner Detector module loaded:The script will begin scanning ports and printing their status.After it checks a number of ports equal to or greater than the scan_threshold configured in the kernel module, the module will identify this activity as a port scan.The kernel module will then block the IP address of the machine running the script.You can verify this by running make stats and make blocked on the target machine.
